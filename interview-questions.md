# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

<!-- First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question. -->

<!-- Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS. -->

<!-- INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: -->  What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement are functions and rules and parameters to figure out whether a statement or is true or false and to follow through what to do after. 

Researched answer: Conditional statements are specific instructions we give the computer to run through and give us a unique output dependent of the value of the input we give it.  It's essentially a set of program instructions we tell the computer to do depending on what the current conditions that are passed through it are... and this builds "logic".

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software used by developers to keep track of the different version of their work. Github is a platform used by developers to use Git.

Researched answer: Git is an open-sourced version control software used by programmers and developers.  It is a tool that is used to share and work on code collaborately using version control features and logs.  This way, many people can work on and contribute to the same code base and there wouldn't be any confusion as to who did what, when, and where. 

GitHub, is an internet hosing service provider for software developers go use git, the software through a GUI. It allows for many features such as navigating through tasks and between team members more easy.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?f

Your answer: >, <, >=, <=, !=, !==, ==, ===.

Researched answer: There are more... 
                    loose equality operator ==
                    strict equality operator ===
                    relational operators >, <, >=, <=
                    logial operators &&, ||, !true, !false, !==, !(&&), !


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the location of the element within the array starting with 0 as the first position of the array.  A value is the data that is assigned to the element within the array.

Researched answer: An index is the chronological location of the elements inside of an array, starting from 0 and increased by on sequentially for each new element. The Value is what is stored in the elements of an array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Arrays are objects that can contain elements, variables, and values.  Strings are strickly word datatypes. 

Researched answer:  The difference between arrays and strings, is that arrays are variables that store a many different data in an ordered list, for example it an store numbers, strings, other variables and other arrays.  

A string is a combination of one or more characters... for example, a word. a symbol, numbers and is often expressed in quotation marks. 

Arrays are variables that store collections of data in an ordered list. A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming consist of a driver(s), person who types out the code and the navigator, the person who steers the direction of the coding process.

good proper pair programming is communicating clearly the problem and objective of the solution and both figuring out how to do so using the available tools such as Github, Zoom and Slack. This way multiple people are working on the project and are able to cross check and validate each other.

Researched answer: 

Pair programming is a software development technique that splits the workload of a project into multpile roles. These roles usually conside of a driver, the person who will be responsible for writing the code, and the navigator, the person who will be responsible for checking the code and giving instructions and guidance, considering the future direction and the strategies of the project. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. 

Higher Order Functions are functions that we can create and use with other functions.

2. Jest: Jess is a testing framework used to check the correctedness of javascript code.tI don't really understand how it works and the benefits of it, yet. 

3. Objects:  Objects are variables that contain elements values and functions. const 

4. Method: Methods are actions that can be used on objects for example flipping the order of the values inside of an array, or turning all the characters in as string to uppcase. Or, returning other property values. 

5. Classes:  

A class is a template for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data, grouping data and functionality together.
