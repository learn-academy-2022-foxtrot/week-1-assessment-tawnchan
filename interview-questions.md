# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement are functions and rules and parameters to figure out whether a statement or is true or false and to follow through what to do after. 

Researched answer: Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow you create logic in your code.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software used by developers to keep track of the different version of their work. Github is a platform used by developers to use Git.

Researched answer: Git is a free, open-sourced version control system widely used in the programming world. It is a very powerful tool used for sharing and working on code and allows for many people to contribute to the same code base. 

GitHub, Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: >, <, >=, <=, !=, !==, ==, ===.

Researched answer: i got the same..

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the location of the element within the array starting with 0 as the first position of the array.  A value is the data that is assigned to the element within the array.

Researched answer: Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value.

Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Arrays are objects that can contain elements, variables, and values.  Strings are strickly word datatypes. 

Researched answer:  Arrays are variables that store collections of data in an ordered list. A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming consist of a driver(s), person who types out the code and the navigator, the person who steers the direction of the coding process.

good proper pair programming is communicating clearly the problem and objective of the solution and both figuring out how to do so using the available tools such as Github, Zoom and Slack. This way multiple people are working on the project and are able to cross check and validate each other.

Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. 

Higher Order Functions are functions that we can create and use with other functions.

2. Jest: Jess is a testing framework used to check the correctedness of javascript code.tI don't really understand how it works and the benefits of it, yet. 

3. Objects:  Objects are variables that contain elements values and functions. const 

4. Method: Methods are actions that can be used on objects for example flipping the order of the values inside of an array, or turning all the characters in as string to uppcase. Or, returning other property values. 

5. Classes:  

A class is a template for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data, grouping data and functionality together.
